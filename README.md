Project Summary:
The CornerGrocer project aims to manage and analyze grocery item data from an input file.
It calculates and displays the frequency of each item, generates histograms, and outputs the data to a file. 
This program serves to assist in inventory management and data visualization for grocery store operations.

What I Did Particularly Well:
I effectively designed the program to handle file operations, data manipulation, and user interactions through a clear menu system. 
Error handling for invalid inputs was implemented to ensure robust user interaction.

Areas for Code Enhancement:
To enhance the code, I could implement more robust error handling, particularly around file I/O operations and data validation. 
Improvements in efficiency could involve optimizing data structures or algorithms used for frequency calculations. 
Security could be enhanced by validating user inputs more rigorously to prevent potential vulnerabilities.

Challenging Pieces of Code and Solutions:
One of the challenges was implementing the histogram display function efficiently, ensuring it correctly represented item frequencies using asterisks. 
I overcame this by iterating through the frequency map and dynamically generating the histogram representation based on the frequency count.

Transferable Skills:
Skills gained in file handling, data structures (like maps), user input validation, and modular programming will be highly transferable to other 
projects requiring data analysis and interactive user interfaces. These skills are foundational in software development and applicable across various domains.

Maintaining Readability and Adaptability:
To ensure maintainability, readability, and adaptability, I structured the code with clear functions encapsulating specific tasks.
Descriptive function and variable names were used, and comments were added where necessary to explain logic and functionality. 
This approach not only aids in understanding the code but also facilitates future updates or modifications.
